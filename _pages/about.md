Hi there!

I am a Ph.D. student in the Quantitative Psychology program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am interested in psychometrics, latent variable modeling, and decision making. My primary research is about developing/applying quantitative methods to solve problems in educational and psychological research, and to understand factors influencing judgments. Current projects includes (longitudinal) cognitive diagnostic models, differential item functioning (DIF), item response theory (IRT), Bayesian statistics, and cognitive modeling.

I obtained a B.A in Psychology and a B.S in Data Science & Statistics from Miami University in Ohio. In my free time, I enjoy reading comics / mangas, listening and singing to music, and playing video games.
